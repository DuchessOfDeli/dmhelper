# DM Helper
If you're a Dungeon master and you don't always want to have access to the internet to use a similar online version of tools like these, you may find mine to be useful. What kind of tools? Well, I plan on converting all the tables in the DM's guide into simple tools that you can use with the click of a button. Most of them are just random tables so I figure, this would be a good jumping off point. I started this in order to learn computer science and to hopefully make it easier for my future D&D sessions as well as for others'.
